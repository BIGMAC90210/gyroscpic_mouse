# gyroscpic_mouse
A program that tracks head movement via a gyroscope, magnetometer, &amp; accelerometer 

To use the code, create a folder called SFE_LSM9DS0 underneath {install directory}/Adruino/libraries, and put SFE_LSM9DS0.cpp and SFE_LSM9DS0.h in that folder. Then you can open headMouse2.ino and load it to your Arduino.
